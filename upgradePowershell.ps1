#Requires -Version 2.0

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Upgrades PowerShell to version 5.1 by installing .NET Framework 4.5.2 and installing the proper Windows Management Framework (WMF) for the OS.
.DESCRIPTION
    Upgrades PowerShell to version 5.1 by installing .NET Framework 4.5.2 and installing the proper Windows Management Framework (WMF) for the OS.
.EXAMPLE
    -ForceRestart

    - Downloads and installs .NET Framework 4.5.2, followed by PowerShell 5.1, and schedules a restart.

PARAMETER: -ForceRestart
    A system restart will be scheduled to occur 60 seconds after the script has successfully completed.

.NOTES
    Minimum OS Architecture Supported: Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
    Release Notes: The script has been updated to support Windows 7 SP1 and Server 2008 R2 SP1. Readability has been improved, and throw statements have been replaced with Write-Host for better error handling. 
    Exchange detection has been enhanced, and installer logs have been added for better troubleshooting. The script is now more verbose and includes improved support for x86 systems. 
    It will now properly error out on incompatible systems. Additionally, it uses a standard downloader, includes installer verification, and performs installation success checks. 
    Detection of pre-existing PowerShell installations has also been improved.
